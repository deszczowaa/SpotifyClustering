As you can see, some of the features look totally different between the clusters. Thanks to this difference and the fact that the songs within each cluster have similar values of these features, we can group the songs. This way, your playlist can be divided into two or more playlists that display a specific set of features. Sometimes it happens that the clustering algorithm is capable of dividing the playlists by genres. Let's see how it worked in your case.

In the first picture you can see the overall division of songs when it comes to three features: loudness, acousticness and valence. Next, you can see all songs that have been added to both groups. Some titles might not fit much to any playlist (they are called outliers). They are separated from the rest of the songs.
