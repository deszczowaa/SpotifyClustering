Your Spotify playlist was grouped based on the following features:
-   acousticness - confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic; 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic
-   danceability - describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity; a value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable
-   duration_ms - duration of track in miliseconds
-   energy -  measure from 0.0 to 1.0 that represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity; typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy
-   instrumentalness - predicts whether a track contains no vocals.; "ooh" and "aah" sounds are treated as instrumental in this context; rap or spoken word tracks are clearly "vocal"; the closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content
-   key - the key of the track using Pitch Class Notation (values 0-11, if no key detected - value of -1)
-   liveness - detects the presence of an audience in the recording; higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live; a value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live
-   loudness - the overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB); loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks; loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude)
-   mode - is the song major (1) or minor (0)
-   speechiness - detects the presence of spoken words in a track; the more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value
-   tempo - the overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM); in musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration
-   time_signature - a notational convention to specify how many beats are in each bar (or measure); the time signature ranges from 3 to 7 indicating time signatures of "3/4", to "7/4"
-   valence - a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track; tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry)
